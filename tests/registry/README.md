# Registry verification

`go test ./tests/registry` builds stable and preview binaries, checks every
Registry request member against its flag and schema, and exercises serialization
through a signed local HTTPS server. It is not cloud-service evidence.

## Authorized live tests

These tests create and delete Registry resources. Supply credentials for an
explicitly authorized account and region. They use an isolated CLI home and
confirm deletion with a fresh cleanup context; do not point them at production
resources.

Build the stable candidate with `go build -o /tmp/agr-registry ./cmd/agr`.
To verify the preview channel, add `-tags=preview` to the same build command.
Set `TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_ID`, `TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_KEY`, optional
`TENCENTCLOUD_TOKEN`, and `AGR_REGION` using your credential provider. Then run:

```sh
AGR_REGISTRY_E2E_BINARY=/tmp/agr-registry \
AGR_REGISTRY_E2E_SCENARIO=registry.lifecycle \
AGR_REGISTRY_FIXTURE_URL=https://YOUR-REVIEWED-FIXTURE \
go test ./internal/patchscenarios -run TestRegistryLive -count=1 -v -timeout=8m
```

The full scenario covers CUSTOM approval/rejection/cancellation, labels, filtered
lists and audit logs, manual MCP/A2A content, version deletion, Skill package
upload/download checksums and manual Markdown, and remote MCP/A2A preview/sync
(unchanged, changed, and failed fetch). All successful responses are checked
against the effective API schema. Optional fields absent from a real response
are not asserted to have been observed; their serialization is covered by the
local binary tests.

For diagnosis, the component scenarios are `registry.custom.lifecycle`,
`registry.skill.lifecycle`, and `registry.remote.lifecycle`. A component pass
is not a complete Registry lifecycle validation.

## Remote metadata fixture

`fixture/main.ts` is a standalone Deno service with no secrets or dependencies.
Deploy that directory to an explicitly authorized Deno Deploy test app. It
implements MCP metadata and an A2A 1.0 Agent Card only; it cannot execute tools.
`/case/<changeAt>/<failAt>/mcp` and `/case/<changeAt>/<failAt>/agent.json` path timestamps change metadata and return HTTP 503,
respectively, without mutable shared state. Each test gets an independent URL.
The default change and failure windows are each 1 minute. Set
`AGR_REGISTRY_FIXTURE_WINDOW` (30s to 3m) for slower environments; the scenario
timeout scales accordingly, up to 14 minutes. The 3-minute cap leaves 6 minutes
of the strict runner's 20-minute budget for builds, other lifecycles and cleanup. If a phase overruns its window, the run fails and
requires a larger window, never a passing result. Increase the outer `go test -timeout` too when using larger windows. Time windows reduce but do not eliminate
sensitivity to unusually slow cloud calls.
Run `deno test --no-config tests/registry/fixture` to check the fixture locally.

## Evidence boundary

`go run ./cmd/internal/apipatch coverage` checks that every contract delta is
bound to registered assertions. Promoted Registry Actions no longer contribute
overlay entries. The command does not execute cloud tests, and local binary
tests do not prove service acceptance.

Candidates containing a non-empty API patch still need the separate strict
preview E2E report required by [PATCH-VERIFICATION.md](../../PATCH-VERIFICATION.md).
Generate that report only after a clean candidate commit and PR head exist;
Registry lifecycle runs and local working-tree tests do not substitute for it.
